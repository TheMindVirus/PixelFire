pare/luce/sore/aoce
flex/sorb/posh/emit

[current_renderer]
parent - powerful light/matter - AM (amplitude modulation) [transparent] {emissive-hdr} - usually projected emissively or incident
lucent - luminous light/matter - RM (recurring modulation) [translucent] {transmissive} - internally reflected density distribution
sorent - absorbed light/matter - FM (frequency modulation) [opaque-null] {albedo-solid} - standard texture or material occlusion
aocent - occluded light/matter - HM (heuristic modulation) [dark-ignore] {textured-odd} - shadowed darkened granular randomness

[physical_principles]
transit - no change to the direction of light ({"normal"} -> "delta-angle")
scatter - spin perpendicularly or otherwise to the direction of light ({"tangent"} -> "delta-angle")
reflect - exactly oppose the direction of light ({"metallic"} -> "delta-angle")
neglect - completely ignore the direction of light ({"smoothness"} -> "delta-angle")

[standard_materials]
pare - transit parent light, transit lucent light, transit sorent light, transit aocent light (invisible)
luce - scatter parent light, scatter lucent light, scatter sorent light, scatter aocent light (crystal)
sore - reflect parent light, reflect lucent light, reflect sorent light, reflect aocent light (solid)
aoce - neglect parent light, neglect lucent light, neglect sorent light, neglect aocent light (null)

[characteristic_materials]
flex - reflect parent light, scatter lucent light, transit sorent light, neglect aocent light (matte-canvas)
sorb - neglect parent light, transit lucent light, scatter sorent light, reflect aocent light (refractive-plexiglass)
posh - scatter parent light, reflect lucent light, neglect sorent light, transit aocent light (polished-crystalline)
emit - transit parent light, neglect lucent light, reflect sorent light, scatter aocent light (neon-tube)

[product_brief]
e.g. An ultrawide stage-scale curved projection display wall with liquid crystal alpha channel
     for live cinematic e-sports with toggled visibility of the staging behind the main screen
     using the auxiliary DVI output on the back of a projector with hardware mapper-framebuffer
     externally projection mapped, liquid crystals controlled physically by video alpha channel
     with flex->sorb (1.0->0.0) and opaq characteristics to block projected light from players' eyes
     (optional: posh mirror pixels as -1.0 alpha, labels compatible with quad alpha-numeric LED readouts)
