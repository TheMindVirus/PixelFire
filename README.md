# PixelFire - Swarm Engine
### 3D Volumetric Mesh Particle System in Unity

Swarm Engine focusses on Games and light animations based on 3D Particle Systems \
where each particle is allowed to draw its own 8x8x8 Volumetric Grid with Alpha in Real-Time. \
There are settings to tweak (e.g. half4 instead of float4) for compatibility with Mobile and Web GPU's.

The float3x4 transform that describes particle properties is laid out in the following way:

### Please Note: This builds for WebGL but IL2CPP does not support Mesh GPU Instancing in WebGL Builds.

*The running joke is that swarm stands for sw-arm as in software that runs on arm processors. It's that backwards.*
